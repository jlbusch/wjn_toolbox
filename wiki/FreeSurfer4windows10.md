This is a short walkthrough on how to run Freesurfer from the Windows command line using Windows 10 Pro Version 1803 build 17134.799 with Ubuntu 18.04 LTS.
Date of creation is November 25th 2019.

The entire install including Downloads (depending on your connection) took me less than 20 minutes.

First install the Windows subsystem for Linux which gives you access to a Linux shell from here on called bash:

Open Start.
Search for PowerShell, right-click it and Run as administrator.
Type the following command to add the required module and press Enter:

Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux

Type Y to complete the installation and restart your computer.

An easy way to install Linux distros on Windows 10 is to use the Windows Store, find Ubuntu and install.

Run Ubuntu from the start menu
Ubuntu will install (takes a while) and will ask you for a username and password (you can choose)

To get Ubuntu bash online you need to define the Charit√© proxy, therefore open the proxy configuration script with nano:

sudo nano /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/proxy.conf

write the lines:

Acquire::http::proxy "http://proxy.charite.de:8080";
Acquire::https::proxy "https://proxy.charite.de:8080";
Acquire::ftp::proxy "ftp://proxy.charite.de:8080";

save with Ctrl+O Enter
and exit with Ctrl+X Enter

Now use apt-get update

Install necessary packages:

sudo apt-get install tcsh libfreetype6 libglu1-mesa libfontconfig1 libxrender1 libsm6 libxt6 libgomp1

Create the folder /mnt/c/linux/

Change to windows and download Freesurfer tar.gz file from the freesurfer website:
https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/DownloadAndInstall

Back in Ubuntu cd /mnt/c/linux/ and run

sudo tar -C /usr/local -xzvf freesurfer-Linux-centos6_x86_64-stable-pub-v6.0.0.tar.gz

This will take as while and install freesurfer to /usr/local/freesurfer/ as recommended.

You can now delete the tar.gz file in the C:\linux\ folder to free up space.

If you don't have one, obtain a license file from:
https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/registration.html

In Windows you can place the license file in your C:\linux\ folder.
Next in Ubuntu you can move the file to the freesurfer folder:

sudo mv /mnt/c/linux/license.txt /usr/local/freesurfer/

Next you add a folder where you want to store (can be temporarily) your freesurfer subject data. 

mkdir /mnt/c/linux/freesurfer_subjects/

Finally, you need to define FREESUFER_HOME and SUBJECTS_DIR. and set it up. You can do that with every start from command line or by adding it to .bashrc. Write these lines:

To do that use nano ~/.bashrc, scroll to the end and add:

# Source freesurfer with bash startup
export FREESURFER_HOME=/usr/local/freesurfer
source $FREESURFER_HOME/SetUpFreeSurfer.sh
export SUBJECTS_DIR=/mnt/c/linux/freesurfer_subjects/
cd $SUBJECTS_DIR

You restart the Ubuntu bash and can do a test using the following command:

cd $SUBJECTS_DIR
sudo cp $FREESURFER_HOME/subjects/sample-001.mgz .
mri_convert sample-001.mgz sample-001.nii.gz

If it worked you can now use the windows explorer to find both the original sample-001.mgz and the converted sample-001.nii.gz file in your freesurfer_subjects folder.

You can now run recon-all from windows command line or within matlab or python using:

bash -ic "recon-all -i yourfile.nii -s yoursubjectname -all
